Hello, I'm Riley!

I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engineer currently pursuing a degree in Software Development at WGU (Night Owls come say hi!). That doesn't mean I'll be switching careers, it's more about writing better code as an SRE.

I'm a gamer and semi-professional game designer, mostly for live action games.

At some point I'll consider developing this out more. Until then, feel free to check out my bare bones site at [https://rileyseaman.com](https://rileyseaman.com)!
